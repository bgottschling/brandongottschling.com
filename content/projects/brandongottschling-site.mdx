> **Why**  
> I wanted a single home for research notes, projects, and writing—lightweight, fast, and easy to grow. This site is my “living workshop,” where I build in public and keep the work portable.

## Status

- **Current:** Active v0.1  
- **Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), MDX + file-system content, Tailwind/shadcn, `remark-gfm`, `rehype-slug`/`autolink-headings`, Vercel.  
- **Design:** warm, minimal UI; card components; animated background network with periodic “harmony” moments.

## What I built

- **Content system:** MDX + front-matter with a tiny filesystem reader (`/lib/content`).  
- **Components:** `ItemCard`, `MissionCard`, `EthosCard`, and a robust `BackgroundNetworkStable` (canvas) with triangle fills and scheduled “snap” envelopes.  
- **Design tokens:** accent hue + neutrals, typography via Tailwind Typography (scoped), and opaque cards (`not-prose`) for readability over animation.  
- **SEO & basics:** metadata, og image placeholder, robots/sitemap (ready), RSS planned.  
- **Deploy:** Vercel, custom domain.

## Notes from the build

- **MDX choices:** kept `next-mdx-remote` only where needed; most MDX renders natively with the App Router.  
- **Types & configs:** use `next.config.ts` + `@next/mdx` with `remark-gfm` and `rehype` plugins; keep PostCSS/Tailwind in **ESM** format to dodge Turbopack warnings.  
- **Performance guardrails:** DPR cap (1.5), bounded `requestAnimationFrame` delta, spatial grid for neighbor search, and FPS-based triangle fallback.  
- **Accessibility:** high-contrast cards, limited line length (~68ch), tab/focus styles, no global opacity on text containers.

## Takeaways

1. **Ship the scaffolding, then style it.** Getting content flowing through MDX early made every other decision easier.  
2. **Opaque cards over animated backgrounds** keep text legible without killing the vibe.  
3. **Bound your math.** Wrapping angles and capping deltas removed “float gremlins” in the canvas.  
4. **Prefer tokens over hard values.** One accent hue powers links, cards, and the background.  
5. **Build to learn, learn to build.** Small, shippable pieces keep momentum (and faith) up.

## What’s next

- Add `/blog`, `/research`, and `/projects` index pages with filters/tags.  
- Generate OG images for posts/projects.  
- Light analytics (privacy-first) + uptime pings.  
- “/now” page + `/rss.xml`.  
- More project case studies (Unity – Subject 33; Orgami; Crypto Cycle dashboards).
