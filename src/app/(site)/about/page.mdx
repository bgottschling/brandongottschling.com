# About

I’m **Brandon Gottschling**—builder, writer, and tinkerer. This site is my living lab for shipping work across game development (Unity), creative writing like my *Awake* comic, Orgami (SME index MVP), macro/finance notes. Not to mention reflections on the passion project that I started with my wife, LIT Wax Works.

**Mission.** Learn in public, document honestly, and ship small, useful artifacts. Ultimately, I'd like to make a difference. You’ll find research notes, working prototypes, roadmaps, and postmortems.  

**What to expect.**
- Technical writeups (Unity controllers, shaders, pipelines)
- Project hubs with READMEs, “How to run”, and roadmaps
- Blog posts and reflections
- Finance/macro dashboards and methodology notes (not financial advice)
- Portfolio & CV

**Elsewhere.**
